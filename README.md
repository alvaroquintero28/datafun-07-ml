# datafun-07-ml
## In your browser, create a new project GitHub repository (e.g. datafun-07-ml or datafun-07-applied) with default README.md.
Don't forget the default README.md! 
Follow conventions when naming your project repository. 
## Clone your new project repository down to your Documents folder. Use a terminal and the git clone command OR open VS Code and clone. 
## Create a Project Virtual Environment in the .venv folder.  (Hint: In a VS Code terminal in the root project folder, use venv to create a .venv folder in the root project repository folder.)
## Activate the Project Virtual Environment.  (Hint: In a VS Code terminal in the root project folder, run the command that depends on your operating system. It calls a script in the .venv folder you just created. 
## Manage Project Requirements.
Install dependencies (see recommended list in the spec to start with). 
Freeze your requirements to requirements.txt.  (We can always install more packages and re-freeze to requirements.txt as we go.)
Add a useful .gitignore to the root project folder. (Hint: use the example in the spec or start with your own from prior projects.)
Document your process and commands in your README.md.
## Git add and commit the changes made on your machine.
## Git push your changes to GitHub.
Make sure your README.md includes the purpose of the project, the virtual environment setup, and commands used to git add / commit / push to GitHub, and how to run your code.
